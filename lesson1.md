                    <aside class="notes">A typical web site will live or is "hosted" on a web server.
                        Web servers are often large computers connected to a network.
                        Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer 
                          connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software 
                         available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).
                        Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, 
                        a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's 
                        web browser.

                <h3>Client Side vs. Server Side</h3>
                  <p class="fragment">Client Side: Stuff happening on your computer independently of the server (For our discussion, think client = browser)</p><br/>
                  <p class="fragment">Server Side: Requests being fulfilled by a server ("send me these documents")</p><br/>
                  <p class="fragment">Clients make requests, servers fulfill them</p><br/>

                  <p>The simplest type of request you can send is a "ping." It asks the server "are you there?"</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Open the command line (Windows) or the terminal (Mac)</li><br/>
                    <li>to send a request from the client (your local machine) to the server: Type "ping google.com" and see what happens</li><br/>
                    <li>Try some different websites</li><br/>

                <ul>
                  <li>Developed in 1996 by Brendan Eich.</li><br/>
                  <li>JavaScript is a programming language is basically a set of strings
                  (letters, numbers, commands) that is changed into machine code that the computer can understand.</li><br/>
                  <li>Javascript IS NOT Java </li><br/>

                  <h3>What can Javascript do?</h3>
                  <p class="fragment">Static vs. Dynamic sites</p><br/>
    
                  <p class="fragment">Javascript enables you to add interactivity to your site, to make your site dynamic.</p><br/>
    
                                <aside class="notes">
                                  A static website contains Web pages with fixed content.
                                  Each page is coded in HTML and displays the same information to
                                  every visitor. Static sites are the most basic type of website
                                  and are the easiest to create. Unlike dynamic websites, they do not
                                  require any Web programming or database design.
                                  A static site can be built by simply creating a few HTML pages and
                                  publishing them to a Web server.
