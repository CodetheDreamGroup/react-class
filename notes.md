## Other thoughts
* What is the best starting environment for the students?
    * Probably best to not have to get through npm, git, etc just to get started.
* Did you use Github during the basics course? I can't tell, but I see it mentioned.


## Items the iterns can help with

## Things I want to learn how to do in RevealJS
* Have no transition between slides using markdown
* Have bits of code wrapped in fragments to gradually reveal code
* Get fragments to work as expected with a bold word in text in markdown.
    Right now it only hides the last bold word in the text as the fragment, which is cool but not what I expected.
